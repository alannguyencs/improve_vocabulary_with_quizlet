extend|we modify and __________ this architecture such that it works with very few training images and yields more precise segmentations
associated|these are not currently popular, possibly due to lack of appropriate metrics or __________ recognition challenges
capture|to __________ performance for all classes (stuff and things) in an interpretable and unified manner
rigorous|using the proposed metric, we perform a __________ study of both human and machine performance
additional|the original mnist is augmented with __________ noise and distortion in order to make the problem more challenging
reveal|to __________ interesting insights about the task
revive|the aim of our work is to __________ the interest of the community in a more unified view of image segmentation
dominant|in the early days of computer vision, things â€“ countable objects  received the __________ share of attention
elevated|questioning the wisdom of this trend, adelson __________ the importance of studying systems that recognize stuff
commonly|studying stuff is most __________ formulated as a task known as semantic segmentation
amorphous|as stuff is __________ and uncountable, this task is defined as simply assigning a class label to each pixel in an image
treats|note that semantic segmentation __________ thing classes as stuff
formulated|in contrast, studying things is typically __________ as the task of object detection or instance segmentation
substantially|while seemingly related, the datasets, details, and metrics for these two visual recognition tasks vary __________
dilations|stuff classifiers are usually built on fully convolutional nets with __________
