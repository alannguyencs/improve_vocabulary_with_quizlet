treats|note that semantic segmentation __________ thing classes as stuff
deploy|the loss function is easy to __________ and combine with other pixel-wise prediction tasks
amorphous|as stuff is __________ and uncountable, this task is defined as simply assigning a class label to each pixel in an image
novel|we proposed a __________ objective to train a network to perform a clustering-based instance labeling
associated|an example __________ with the idea of equation 3 is illustrated in figure 2
advances|recent __________ in object detection are driven by the success of region proposal methods and rcnn
computationally|rcnn were __________ expensive as originally developed
drastically|their cost has been __________ reduced thanks to sharing convolutions across proposals
nevertheless|__________ the region proposal step still consumes as much running time as the detection network
advantage|fast rcnns take __________ of gpus, while the region proposal methods are implemented on the cpu, making such runtime comparisons inequitable
accelerate|an obvious way to __________ proposal computation is to reimplement it for the gpu
elegant|leads to an __________ and effective solution
observation|our __________ is that the convolutional feature maps can also be used for generating region proposals
additional|on top of these convolutional features, we construct an rpn by adding a few __________ convolutional layers
simultaneously|that __________ regress region bounds and objectness scores at each location on a regular grid
