We modify and extend this architecture such that it works with very few training images and yields more precise segmentations
the original MNIST is augmented with additional noise and distortion in order to make the problem more challenging
Panoptic segmentation unifies the typically distinct tasks of semantic segmentation and instance segmentation
assign a class label to each pixel
detect and segment each object instance
The proposed task requires generating a coherent scene segmentation that is rich and complete
early work in computer vision addressed related image/scene parsing tasks
these are not currently popular, possibly due to lack of appropriate metrics or associated recognition challenges
to capture performance for all classes (stuff and things) in an interpretable and unified manner
Using the proposed metric, we perform a rigorous study of both human and machine performance
to reveal interesting insights about the task
The aim of our work is to revive the interest of the community in a more unified view of image segmentation
In the early days of computer vision, things â€“ countable objects  received the dominant share of attention
Questioning the wisdom of this trend, Adelson elevated the importance of studying systems that recognize stuff
Studying stuff is most commonly formulated as a task known as semantic segmentation
As stuff is amorphous and uncountable, this task is defined as simply assigning a class label to each pixel in an image
note that semantic segmentation treats thing classes as stuff
In contrast, studying things is typically formulated as the task of object detection or instance segmentation
While seemingly related, the datasets, details, and metrics for these two visual recognition tasks vary substantially
Stuff classifiers are usually built on fully convolutional nets with dilations
Overall algorithmic progress on these tasks has been incredible in the past decade
One trivial solution is to increase the number of samples on the background region
We push this notion to the extreme and use all background pixels for training
However, we only consider the unary prediction instead of pairwise relationships
an example associated with the idea of equation 3 is illustrated in figure 2
we apply equation 3 on top of the outputs of a softmax layer in a standard FCN which was originally designed for semantic segmentation
The loss function is easy to deploy and combine with other pixel-wise prediction tasks
the number of pairs grow quadratically with the number of pixels in an image
it is not feasible to use all pixels in an image
we adopt a sampling strategy
we proposed a novel objective to train a network to perform a clustering-based instance labeling
by adjusting the sampling method, we are able to inject the graph coloring strategy into the learning objective
to demonstrate the generalizability and applicability of proposed learning strategy
besides the effect of semantic segmentation and confidence ranking
another dominant failure mode is that neighboring segments are assigned with the same ID
an example is the third row in figure 6 which merges adjacent cars
another defect is that the network sometimes does over-segmentation
we leave possible enhancement for future work
the results show a clear trend that the AP increased as the semantic segmentation enhanced
our method has significant advantage over the JGD which also leverages the graph labeling concept
Recent advances in object detection are driven by the success of region proposal methods and RCNN
RCNN were computationally expensive as originally developed
their cost has been drastically reduced thanks to sharing convolutions across proposals
Nevertheless the region proposal step still consumes as much running time as the detection network
fast RCNNs take advantage of GPUs, while the region proposal methods are implemented on the CPU, making such runtime comparisons inequitable
An obvious way to accelerate proposal computation is to reimplement it for the GPU
leads to an elegant and effective solution
Our observation is that the convolutional feature maps can also be used for generating region proposals
On top of these convolutional features, we construct an RPN by adding a few additional convolutional layers
that simultaneously regress region bounds and objectness scores at each location on a regular grid
Since the background contains the majority of pixels in an image
the sampled points are very sparse
the density of sampled points on background is roughly 0.005%
In fact the predicted instances tend to stretch significantly into the background region
The human visual system is fast and accurate, allowing us to perform complex tasks with little conscious thought
to enable assistive devices to convey real-time scene information to human users
Current detection systems repurpose classifiers to perform detection
these systems take a classifier for that object and evaluate it at various locations and scales in a test image
post-processing is used to refine the bounding boxes, eliminate duplicate detections
This unified model has several benefits over traditional methods of object detection
Science proves there are six ways you can learn and retain something faster
You'll need to teach someone else the material or task you are trying to grasp, you can speed up your learning and remember more
the expectation changes your mind-set so that you engage in more effective approaches to learning that whose simply learn to pass a test
sleeping between two learning sessions greatly improves retention
when teachers prepare to teach, they tend to seek out key points and organize information into a coherent structure
Experts suggest dedicating 30-50 minutes to learning new material
getting sleep in between study sessions can boost your recall up to six months later
practice a slightly modified version of a task you want to master
