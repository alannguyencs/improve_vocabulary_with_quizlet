# Improve vocabulary with Quizlet
When studying a new language, it is necessary to build a rich vocabulary. Quizlet a a great tool to support us remember terms and definitions. However, it is time-consuming to collect terms and definitions, and then copy them one by one to quizlet cells. Therefore, I develop this tool to automatically generate terms (in form of keywords) and definitions (in form of sentences with keyword gap) to support you tackling this problem.

# How to use it?
Firstly, you need to build your sentences or phrases collection, and copy them to yourname_collection.txt. Then, you also need build your own keywords to yourname_keywords.txt. Finally, run this tool to generate a Quizlet set for your own vocabulary. Refer to this link for visualize how it work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ntUE4-URhw
