# Improve vocabulary with Quizlet
When studying a new language, it is necessary to build a rich vocabulary. Quizlet a a great tool to support us remember terms and definitions. However, it is time-consuming to collect terms and definitions, and then copy them one by one to quizlet cells. Therefore, I develop this tool to automatically generate terms (in form of keywords) and definitions (in form of sentences with keyword gap) to support you tackling this problem.
