# Improve vocabulary with Quizlet
When studying a new language, it is necessary to build a rich vocabulary. Quizlet a a great tool to support us remember terms and definitions. However, it is time-consuming to collect terms and definitions, and then copy them one by one to quizlet cells. Therefore, I develop this tool to automatically generate terms (in form of keywords) and definitions (in form of sentences with keyword gap) to support you tackling this problem.

# Learning strategy
It is definitely bad to remember all of new words in a single time. My vocabulary strategy divides sentence collection into blocks with size of 10 sentences. Each time generating new quizlet set, I pick exactly 10 new sentences in the collection. Additionally, recalling old sentences is also necessary. Then, I randomly pick 5 old sentences to remind. In total, each quizlet set consists of 15 sentences, including 10 new sentences and 5 random old sentences. Additionally, I add one more function generating randomly 15 sentences from the past, you may try it using the review mode.

# How to use it?
Firstly, you need to build your sentences or phrases collection, and copy them to yourname_collection.txt. Then, you also need build your own keywords to yourname_keywords.txt. Finally, run this tool to generate a Quizlet set for your own vocabulary. Refer to this link for visualize how it work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ntUE4-URhw
